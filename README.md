# PansLearn-Framework
An opensource and funny data mining framework.  
  
This framework is started from my C Language class homework.  
And this is my frist time to make a project with C++.  
I will keep learning C++ and data mining and will try to update this project as i can.  
  
If you have some suggestions for me, send to my Email: cs_xcy@126.com.  
Please give me more encouragement although i do know this code is just a piece of shit :)
